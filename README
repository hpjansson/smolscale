Smolscale
=========

Smolscale is a smol piece of C code for quickly scaling images to a reasonable
level of quality using CPU resources only (no GPU). It operates on 4-channel
data with 32 bits per pixel, i.e. packed RGBA, ARGB, BGRA, etc. It is byte
ordering agnostic.

The design goals are:

* High speed: Optimized code, within reason. Easily parallelizable.

* Low memory overhead: Mostly on the stack.

* Decent quality: No "jaggies" as produced by nearest-neighbor scaling.

* Simplicity: A C99 environment is the only dependency.

* Ease of use: One-shot and iterative APIs.

Usage
-----

First, read COPYING. If your project meets the requirements, you should be
able to copy smolscale.c and smolscale.h into it and add it to your build
with minimal fuss.

The API documentation lives in smolscale.h along with the public declarations.

Tests
-----

There is a testing and benchmarking program included. It lives in test.c.
You should be able to build it by simply issuing 'make'. It also allows you
to test a few non-smol image scaling implementations.

You need the development files for the following dependencies installed first
(these are for test.c only and are not needed for Smolscale proper):

* gdx-pixbuf

* libpng

* pixman

* SDL_gfx
